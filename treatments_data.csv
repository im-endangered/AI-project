Disease,Treatment
AIDS,"HIV is treated with antiretroviral medicines, which work by stopping the virus replicating in the body. This allows the immune system to repair itself and prevent further damage. A combination of HIV drugs is used because HIV can quickly adapt and become resistant."
Alzheimer's disease,"There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, although medication is available that can temporarily reduce some symptoms or slow down the progression of the condition in some people.Support is also available to help someone with the condition cope with everyday life."
Appendicitis,"If you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy. Surgery is usually also recommended if there's a chance you have appendicitis but it's not been possible to make a clear diagnosis. This is because it's considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting."
Asthma,"Asthma can usually be managed with rescue inhalers to treat symptoms (salbutamol) and controller inhalers that prevent symptoms (steroids). Severe cases may require longer-acting inhalers that keep the airways open (formoterol, salmeterol, tiotropium), as well as inhalant steroids."
Bronchitis,"Most cases of bronchitis do not require treatment from a GP, and the symptoms can be easily managed at home. There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but healthy living will help. In particular, you should stop smoking, if you smoke."
Chicken pox,"Chickenpox can be prevented by a vaccine. Treatment usually involves relieving symptoms, although high-risk groups may receive antiviral medication."
Common cold,"There's no cure for the common cold. Most cases of the common cold get better without treatment, usually within a week to 10 days. But a cough may linger for a few more days. The best thing you can do is take care of yourself while your body heals. For example, drink plenty of liquids, humidify the air, use saline nasal rinses and get adequate rest. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses and shouldn't be used unless there's a bacterial infection. Relieving your symptoms can include using over-the-counter medication to reduce fever, body aches, congestion and cough. Some remedies might help ease your symptoms and keep you from feeling so miserable. But there are pros and cons to commonly used cold remedies, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, decongestants, nasal sprays and cough syrups. Don't give OTC cold medications to children."
Conjunctivitis,"Pink eye treatment is usually focused on symptom relief. Your provider may recommend: using artificial tears, cleaning your eyelids with a wet cloth, applying cold or warm compresses several times daily. If you wear contact lenses, you'll be advised to stop wearing them until treatment is complete. Your provider will likely recommend that you throw out soft contacts you've already worn. Disinfect hard lenses overnight before you reuse them. Ask your provider if you should discard and replace your contact lens accessories, such as the lens case used before or during the illness. Also replace any eye makeup used before your illness. In most cases, you won't need antibiotic eye drops. Since conjunctivitis is usually viral, antibiotics won't help. They may even cause harm by reducing their effectiveness in the future or causing a medicine reaction. Instead, the virus needs time to run its course. This typically takes around 2 to 3 weeks. Viral conjunctivitis often begins in one eye and then infects the other eye within a few days. Your symptoms should gradually clear on their own. Antiviral medicines may be an option if your viral conjunctivitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus."
Coronavirus,"If you have COVID-19 and are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, treatments are available that can reduce your chances of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. Medications to treat COVID-19 must be prescribed by a healthcare provider and started as soon as possible after diagnosis to be effective. Contact a healthcare provider right away to determine if you are eligible for treatment, even if your symptoms are mild right now."
